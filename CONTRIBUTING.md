# Contributing

First of all, thanks for contributing!

This document provides some basic guidelines for contributing to this repository.
To propose improvements, feel free to submit a PR.

## Submitting issues

Please open an issue first before working on adding a feature or fixing a bug so we can have a quick discussion about it first.


## Pull Requests

Have you fixed a bug or written a new check and want to share it? Many thanks!

In order to ease/speed up our review, here are some items you can check/improve
when submitting your PR:

* Have a [proper commit history](#commits) (we advise you to rebase if needed).
* Write tests for the code you wrote.
* Make sure that all tests pass locally.
* Summarize your PR with a meaningful title.

Your pull request must pass all CI tests before we will merge it.

### Keep it small, focused

Avoid changing too many things at once. For instance if you're fixing two different
checks at once, it makes reviewing harder and the _time-to-release_ longer.


### Commit Messages

Please don't be this person: `git commit -m "Fixed stuff"`. Take a moment to
write meaningful commit messages.

The commit message should describe the reason for the change and give extra details
that will allow someone later on to understand in 5 seconds the thing you've been
working on for a day.
