# appsec-event-rules
Store the default AppSec Event rules, created by our security team.  

# Validation
This repository currently represents the source of truth: the rules present here are shipped to clients.  

The CI has a rule validation step (see the [schema sub folder](https://github.com/DataDog/appsec-event-rules/tree/main/schemas)).
Any rule validation must currently be enforced in this repository.
